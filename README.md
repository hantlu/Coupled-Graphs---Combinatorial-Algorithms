"# Coupled-Graphs---Combinatorial-Algorithms" 

This code is written as a project for Combinatorial Algorithms in Bioinformatics subject. Its purpose is to check whether the user's graph (input) is a potential coupled graph and whether it is a 1-graph. Afterwards, it is transformed into its original version and the program checks if it is linear.
